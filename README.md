## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.9.0 :heart:

## Installation

TBD

## Usage

TDB

### **Applies to larger matrix and buffer:**
*In "miscellaneous" directory there are pregenerated traverse paths for larger matrix and buffer. Use them rather than generate every run - it's easier to read file than generate paths. Use 7zip (or simillar tool) to decompress.*  :v:

**Filenames are are basically:**   
> **m**(atrix)**Size** - **b**(uffer)**Size**.

**For example:**

| Filename 	| Matrix size 	| Buffer size 	| File size   (decompressed) 	| Paths 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| m8b8.txt 	| 8 x 8 	| 8 	| ~354 MB 	| 5 503 680 	|
| m6b8.txt 	| 6 x 6 	| 8 	| ~22 MB 	| 331 200 	|
